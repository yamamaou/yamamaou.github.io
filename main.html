        <h4>Hey, I hope we're on good terms when you read this...<br>Things have been shaky recently, I've been really worried about you, about us...<br><br><i>BUT </i> today, is your birthday! Happy Birthday meri pyaari Aina ♥<br><br>How does it feel to finally graduate from being a teenager? Pretty anticlimactic, amirite? But look at it like this. It's the start of a new part of your journey/life. The twenties. The decade when you will, Inshallah, graduate, get a job, become independent, become an awesome doctor, get married (to me, Inshallah ♥), move in (with me) into (o)ur comfy home, become a mother (to our children, Inshallah ♥), and so much more. It's like life is only just beginning. And I want to be right by your side in every moment, in every step, in every breath you take.<br><br>You are genuinely the best thing that ever happened to me. You give me my motivation, my strength, my will to not give up and persevere. I respect you more than anything, more than any other person alive. And I want to respect you and love you even more. I want to give you everything I can, everything I am... You're everything to me, really the highlight of my life.<br><br>You make colors out of grey. <br><br>I want to be the closest to you... the person you come to, to share anything and everything. When you're feeling happy, or sad, gleeful, or angry, excited, or depressed, when you're feeling so much that you can't even describe, or when you're feeling nothing at all, and there's nothing to describe... I want to be the one you come to, knowing that I <i>will</i> listen, I <i>will</i> care, I <i>will</i> comfort you, and I <i>will</i> make all the bad things go away... <br><br> I want to be the person you come to when you're tired of the whole world, when you just want to forget everything, forget your pesky obligations and the stupid rules of society and norms and the expectation to be prim and proper and elegant as a lady, when you want to hide away from the world and just be a free spirit, just be yourself, let your hair down...  <br><br>I want to be your safe space. I want our home to be your haven, my arms to be your heaven. Inshallah ♥<br><br>Please don't shy away from me from sharing everything you're thinking, everything you're feeling. I too, will Inshallah make sure I am always here for you, in the exact way you need me to be in that situation. For you, I want to be better. I want to be everything you need, everything you want. I want to be confident and unyielding, especially when it concerns you. I want to be a mountain of fortitude, a pillar of strength and stability for you, for us. I'm willing to mold and change and be flexible and completely open in every way when it comes to you, because you're worth it.<br><br>You're worth everything.<br><br>I dream of us, I dream of you... You're everything I could ever want, you're really the best of the best. You're an incredible person, and to even be in the position to be this close to you, I am genuinely blessed, Alhamdulillah...<br><br>I love you so much, Aina, mein aap se bohat zyada pyaar karta hoon. I want to be everything you could ever need, everything you could ever want. Mein aap ki zindagi aur aakhirat ke har qadam pe aap ke saath rehna chahta hoon... Har saans aap ki saans mein lena chahta hoon... Har cheez jo bhi mein hoon, uss se barh kar aap ko dena chahta hoon...<br><br>I dream of you.. I dream of us, a time where we're together, lawfully married, living happily in our cozy lil home.. A cold December evening, late on a Friday night.. when we both know we don't have to worry about work the next morning.. We're just enjoying each others' warm embrace, all cuddled up under a blanket, the room dimly lit by soft warm hues, the lil space heater we got last year humming and roaring as it works at full capacity.. At that moment, nothing else would be important, no work obligations, no worries, nothing would matter, except you and me, me and you.. Enjoying each others' presence, recharging ourselves over the weekend after being drained by the whole world bit by bit over the week.. We would be as close to each other as our own hearts.. our relationship and bond stronger than anything. Just seeing you after a long, gruelling day at work, would be enough to make me feel alive again.. Meri pyaari Aina.. Your soothing voice enough to reassure me, that I'm in my safe place now.. everything is perfect now.. And on days you come home later.. I would come to the door to greet you with a smile and a kiss, with a cute apron on and everythting, make all your worries and all your tiredness go away as I offer you a nice planned course of a bath I readied for you, dinner I prepared for us.. and other.. activities in our bedroom, that ensure that you're completely relaxed and in a state of bliss when you gently fall asleep, and I give you a kiss and tuck you in.. <br><br>I dream of us, our life together, so much.. I perfectly know life isn't a storybook, things won't always be perfect.. But Inshallah, as long as we both love each other and try, we will be the happiest together.. You won't ever have to worry about not being able to say something to me. Whether it's something that's bothering you, something you're thinking, something I said or did, something you want.. I pray you will always be able to freely and honestly talk to me like you're talking to your own heart.. That much of a lack of judgement, and complete openness and complete sincerity for one another. Like we're completely one, two parts of a whole. Not a man and a woman, but a couple of lovebirds, two beings of God, completely one with each other. You feel happy, and I smile. You feel sad, and my heart sinks. As if our hearts, minds, souls are one. That is what I want with you. To be completely one with you. I feel incredibly heartbroken when we grow apart for days and days, for weeks.. I hate myself so much when I hurt you.. Please forgive me..<br><br>... this was supposed to be a birthday note.. heh.. <br><br>I love you, Aina, I love you more than anything. Khush rahein hamesha. Inshallah I'll always be here. I'll always be with you, on your side. Mein hoon idher, mein hoon aapka, aur mein rahoon ga. <br>And I will be strong, I will be a man you can respect and are proud to call your own. <br>Inshallah. <br><br>Ju are the best ♥ <br><br><a href="#top">(back to top)</a></h4>
